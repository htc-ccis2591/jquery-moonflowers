var $What = ("<p>Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup consisting of broth, rice noodles, a few herbs, and meat, primarily made with either beef or chicken. There are two main styles of pho in Vietnam. The Hanoi and Saigon styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs.</p>");

In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Vietnamese refugees brought pho to many countries. Restaurants specilizing in pho appeared in numerous Asian enclaves and Little Saigons, such as in Paris, and in major cities in the United States, Canada, and Australia.</p>");
